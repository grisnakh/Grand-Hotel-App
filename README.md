# Grand-Hotel-App
This is about a mobile application that gives a Grand Hotel the ability to communicate with its clients and promote its services.

I created this as part of my thesis for my university.

The technologies that have been used are:
- HTML5
- ASP.NET MVC 4
- C#
- CSS3
- jQuery
- jQuery Mobile
- Microsoft SQL- Entity Framework

The tool I used is Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
